# Demeter

This repository contains a project named "Demeter" and provides a set of npm scripts to help manage common tasks in both Unix-like and Windows environments. These scripts include checking the environment, restoring project dependencies, building, and running development tasks.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- .NET SDK (v7 or higher)
- Docker

## Installation
